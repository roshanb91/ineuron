    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The empty list value, which is a list value that contains no items. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",

    "Wrong one in yellow, if I correct then the answer as mentioned below. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : Value is : 1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. It will add 99 at last. Like [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list meaning in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: it will remove the first ‘cat’ so answer now [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans Concatenation is + and Replication is *\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: append() : it will add the values at the end of the list and\n",
    "Insert ():  it will add the values anywhere in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : del statement and remove()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Both lists and strings can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.\n",
    "What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Tuples are written as (this)\n",
    "Lists are written as [this]\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans : (42,)\n",

    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  List Values’ form : tuple ()\n",
    "Tuples value’s in list form = List ()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : They contain list values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : copy.copy() : shallow copy\n",
    "copy.deepcopy (): it will do a deep copy. It will duplicate any list inside the list. \n"
